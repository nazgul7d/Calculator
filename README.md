# Calculator
A calculator project  which showcases my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Description
A calculator that runs basic math operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows you to evaluate a pair of (x, y) values together. All results and inputs are displayed on the calculator screen. Decimal numbers are limited up to 3 decimal places.

The calculator has the ability to clear all history and backspace.

Division by zero will give you an interesting message.

Summary
I learned how to plan out the workflow of the project. I kept track of bugs and tested edge cases in order to solve them. I placed an emphasis on code readability and ensured the purpose of each function is clear and concise. Improved string methods and DOM Manipulation understanding.
